# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Introduction
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, posing significant challenges to healthcare systems. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease can greatly enhance the chances of successful treatment and prevention, ultimately saving lives and reducing healthcare costs. Traditional methods of diagnosing heart disease often rely on subjective clinical evaluations and invasive procedures, which can be time-consuming and uncomfortable for patients. This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict heart disease effectively and non-invasively.

## Methodology
Our methodology follows a structured pipeline to ensure comprehensive and effective model development:

1. **Data Acquisition**: Gathering relevant data from various sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Uncovering patterns and insights within the data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating meaningful features to enhance model performance.
5. **Modeling**: Utilizing algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XG Boost.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing models using metrics like precision, recall, and F
