# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Introduction
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, posing significant challenges to healthcare systems. Early detection and accurate prediction of heart disease can greatly enhance the chances of successful treatment and prevention, ultimately saving lives and reducing healthcare costs. Traditional methods of diagnosing heart disease often rely on subjective clinical evaluations and invasive procedures, which can be time-consuming and uncomfortable for patients. This project aims to utilize machine learning techniques to predict heart disease effectively and non-invasively.

## Methodology
Our methodology follows a structured pipeline to ensure comprehensive and effective model development:

### 1. Data Acquisition
The dataset used for identifying heart disease was sourced from the Kaggle platform. It comprises 1000 samples with 16 features, and experts labeled this two-class dataset based on whether patients had heart disease or not.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is crucial in transforming raw data into a clean and usable format. This involves:

- **Data Cleaning**: Addressing inconsistencies and missing values.
- **Data Transformation**: Normalizing, scaling, and encoding categorical variables.
- **Data Reduction**: Dimensionality reduction and feature selection to remove irrelevant or redundant information.

Preprocessing ensures the dataset is accurate, consistent, and formatted correctly, improving the performance and reliability of machine learning models. Effective preprocessing enhances model accuracy, reduces training time, and prevents issues like overfitting or underfitting.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) involves investigating datasets to summarize their main characteristics and uncover patterns, anomalies, or relationships. This includes:

- **Visualizing Data**: Using histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and other charts to identify trends, distributions, and outliers.
- **Summary Statistics**: Calculating mean, median, and standard deviation to describe central tendency and variability.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Evaluating the relationships between different features using correlation matrices and heatmaps to identify highly correlated features.
- **Distribution Analysis**: Checking the distribution of key features such as smoking, age, gender etc to understand their impact on heart disease .

EDA helps make informed decisions about data cleaning, feature selection, and the appropriate analytical methods to use, leading to more accurate and robust results.
### 4. Feature Engineering
Feature engineering enhances model performance by creating new features that better represent the underlying patterns in the data. Techniques used include:

- **Logarithmic Transformation of Blood Pressure**: Normalizes distribution and mitigates extreme values.
- **Composite Feature Creation**: Combining features like Cholesterol_BloodPressure to capture combined effects.
- **Exercise_Stress**: Measure of stress induced by exercise, indicating heart disease risk.
- **Cholesterol_Ratio**: Ratio of HDL (good) cholesterol to LDL (bad) cholesterol.
- **Mean Arterial Pressure**: Provides insight into overall blood pressure condition.
- **Risk Score**: Derived from multiple factors including age, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.

### 5. Machine Learning Models
We utilized several algorithms for modeling:

#### Logistic Regression
A linear model used for binary classification tasks, estimating the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class using a logistic function. It's appreciated for its simplicity, ease of implementation, and interpretability.

#### Decision Trees
Non-linear models that recursively split the data into subsets based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure. They handle both numerical and categorical data and capture non-linear relationships.

#### Random Forests
An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and merges their outputs to improve accuracy and control overfitting. Each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and features.

#### Gradient Boosting
An ensemble technique that builds models sequentially, with each new model focusing on correcting the errors of the previous ones. Known for its high predictive accuracy and ability to handle various data types.

### 6. Model Evaluation
We assess the models using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score to ensure the best model is selected for deployment. The Random Forest and Decision Tree models outperformed others, achieving 99% accuracy in predicting heart disease. Random Forest was chosen for its ability to mitigate overfitting and effectiveness with large datasets compared to Decision Tree.

## Conclusion and Future Work
Random Forest and Decision Tree models demonstrated high accuracy in predicting heart disease. To further enhance the model's accuracy and robustness, we plan to:

- **Expand the Dataset**: Integrate additional data from public health databases and electronic health records.
- **Advanced Modeling Techniques**: Employ data augmentation methods like SMOTE and GANs.
- **Ensemble Techniques**: Use techniques such as stacking to further increase accuracy.

This project highlights the potential of machine learning in improving heart disease prediction and early diagnosis, offering a non-invasive, efficient alternative to traditional methods.
